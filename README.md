# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About the Platform

In this Saas platform, I implemented all requirements and tasks of figma design and furthermore, added a 3d model using three.js.I implemented the 3d fbx model into Canvas from react-three/fiber so that this layout could show the reality.In this layout, there is a wheel panel at the bottom of the canvas.It has 5 controllers and this can control the view of the 3d face model.Of course, even though 3d model is very simple and it does not have a teeth model,  I tried to implement the idea of dentistry service of Modontics.
